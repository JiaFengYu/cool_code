Please use the compile bash script to compile the sudoku executable.
There are 3 fn's: B, B_fc, and B_fc_h.
There are comments about which lines to comment and to uncomment depending on which 
algorithm we want to use and on which sudoku (sorry didn't have enough time to properly
format a i/o system).
Performance data is aggregated in the tables file and a brief explanation follows as well.
The solutions for each sudoku is included in the sols folder.
Traces of each permutation of algorithm and puzzle is included in the b, bfc, bfch traces
folders respectively
